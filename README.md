This repository contains two sample client applications, demonstrating the implementation of two OAuth2 authorization grant flows for FusionFabric.cloud - the authorization code and the client credentials grant flows, in C# - .NET.

To run the sample, go to the sub-project directories - **ffdc-authorization-code** and **ffdc-client-credentials**, and follow the steps from the **`README.md`** files, for more details. 

These sample client applications are released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
